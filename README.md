# Predicting Hazardous NEOs (Nearest Earth Objects)

This project analyzes a dataset of car listings to predict whether a vehicle is in hazardous condition based on various features. The dataset contains over 426,000 records. The project involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and model building using machine learning to predict a specified target variable.

## Overview

This project demonstrates skills in data cleaning, feature engineering, visualization, and predictive modeling. The objective is to build a reliable machine learning model capable of predicting the target label effectively.

## üèóÔ∏è Project Structure

1. ### üì• Import Libraries and Dataset

   Essential libraries for data manipulation, visualization, and machine learning are imported:
   - **numpy** for numerical operations.
   - **pandas** for data manipulation.
   - **matplotlib** and **seaborn** for data visualization.
   - **sklearn** for machine learning.

   **Dataset Details**:
   - Total Records: 426,880 entries
   - Columns: 26, including features like `price`, `year`, `manufacturer`, `model`, `condition`, `cylinders`, `fuel`, `odometer`, and `transmission`.
   - **Note**: Extract the dataset file from any provided compressed format before running the notebook.
   - **Dataset Link**: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/austinreese/craigslist-carstrucks-data/data?authuser=0.

2. ### üõ†Ô∏è Data Preprocessing

   Data preprocessing steps include:
   - **Handling Missing Values**: Using `SimpleImputer` to fill missing data for crucial columns.
   - **Feature Scaling**: Normalizing numerical features.

3. ### üîç Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

   EDA is performed using `matplotlib` and `seaborn`:
   - **Histograms**: Displaying distributions of numerical variables (e.g., `price`, `year`).
   - **Correlation Heatmaps**: Revealing potential interactions between variables and identifying relevant features for the prediction.

   **Questions Answered in EDA**:
   - What is the distribution of cars by region?
   - What is the average price of cars by region?
   - What is the distribution of cars by manufacturer?
